This scene is one of the best and it happend in the Marineford arc

***Why Watch??***
-One Piece shows the difference of perspective and in a way its kind-of political and its a show that you can pick up anytime. Luffy, the main character can not be that likeable but im sure
you'll enjoy watching

***Why you MIGHT not like the show***

its very long and sometimes have boring arcs like thriller bark and long ring long land, which have memorable and funny moments but its generally boring

The pacing is very very bad and in some arcs its horrendous. For example in whole cake island one of the major fights lasted **20** Episodes long
